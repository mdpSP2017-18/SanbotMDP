When the distance between the beacon and the phone is less than 1 meter,
it is better to mount the beacon at 0 degree; For expected distances to the device of 1-6m,
a mount orientation of 90 degrees is most appropriate. Beyond 6m, no single mount
orientation provides a consistently stronger signal. The iPhone 6 Plus has best overall
performance of detecting the RSSI value based on this test.
